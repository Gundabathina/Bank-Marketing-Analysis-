# Bank Marketing Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves a detailed analysis of a bank marketing dataset to understand the factors influencing the success of marketing campaigns. The dataset includes various attributes related to customer demographics, behavior, and previous marketing interactions.
## Objectives
- Data Exploration: Understand the structure and summary statistics of the dataset.
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features to improve model performance.
- Modeling: Apply various machine learning algorithms to predict the success of marketing campaigns.
- Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.

# Dataset
## The dataset used in this analysis is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information about customer interactions with a bank's marketing campaigns, including:

- Age: Age of the customer
- Job: Type of job
- Marital: Marital status
- Education: Level of education
- Default: Whether the customer has credit in default
- Housing: Whether the customer has a housing loan
- Loan: Whether the customer has a personal loan
- Contact: Type of communication contact
- Month: Last contact month of the year
- Day: Last contact day of the week
- Duration: Duration of the last contact
- Campaign: Number of contacts performed during this campaign
- Previous: Number of contacts performed before this campaign
- Poutcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign

# Methodology

# Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the key factors that influence the success of marketing campaigns. The best-performing model can be used to predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit, helping the bank to optimize its marketing strategies.

# Future Work
Explore more advanced feature engineering techniques.
Try other machine learning algorithms like XGBoost or Neural Networks.
